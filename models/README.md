# models

* **targeting** (mathCAS team) - simulate viral genome damage due to cas9 targetting
* **tridimensional** (math3D team) - rational design of cas9 mutants with altered PAM specificity
* **viralassembly** (mathVA team) - model intracellular dynamics of viral assembly in a plant cell
* **viralspread** (mathVS team) - model intercellular dynamics of viral spread through a plant
