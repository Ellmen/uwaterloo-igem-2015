The spreadsheet was created based on Extended Data Figure 2 of Kleinstiver et al. (2015),
"Engineered CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases with altered PAM specificities", Nature,
[doi:10.1038/nature14592]( http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14592.html).
The figure gives the specific amino acid substitutions in the PI domain of spyCas9 that lead to
specificity for two novel PAMs, 'NGC' and 'NGA' (in contrast to the standard 'NGG'). The CSVs contain
the same data with less highlighting.
