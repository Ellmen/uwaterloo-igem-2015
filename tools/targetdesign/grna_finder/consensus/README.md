# sgRNA-CaMV-consensus-script
A script for comparing a genome (i.e.: CaMV) and a generated consensus sequence by creating an array of ungapped regions.

note: script was not used to generate the target regions for the project's sgRNA design, please refer to the sgRNA design folder for the proper protocol.
