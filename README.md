Visit our [website](http://igem.uwaterloo.ca) to learn more about our 2015 project.
The software in this repo is mostly created by the mathematical modelling subteam,
headed by Tessa Alexanian ([@alexanian](http://github.com/alexanian)) and Matt Smart
([@mattsmart](http://github.com/mattsmart)).

* **training** is a messy sandbox of code written during our training sessions  
* **gRNA_target_design** constains files and scripts associated with optimization of Cas9 targets
