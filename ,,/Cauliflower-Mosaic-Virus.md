Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) was chosen as the proof-of-concept for our plant immune system because it infects *A. thaliana* and has a double-stranded genome for much of its life cycle. The dsDNA genome is needed since Cas9 has only been demonstrated *in vivo* with double-stranded PAM sites (though [PAMmers](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v516/n7530/abs/nature13769.html) may change this soon).

### CaMV Genome

The CaMV genome ([NC_001497](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/9626938)) is 8024 bp long and mostly double-stranded. It has 7 ORFs (called gp1-gp7) though the function for gp1 has yet to be identified. The ORFs with known functions are the genes P1-P6, where P1 is gp2. A visualization of the CaMV genome, created after importing the NCBI record into [Benchling](http://benchling.com), is shown below.

Two mRNA transcripts are produced by CaMV: the 19S transcript, which encodes only the protein P6, and the 35S transcript, which contains the template for reproduction of the entire genome. P6 trans-activates the proteins P1-P5 on the 35S transcript, which have the following functions: P1, the movement protein; P2, the aphid transmission factor; P3, a virion-associated packaging protein; P4, the main caspid coating protein and P5, a polyprotein precursor of reverse transcriptase, proteinase and and ribonuclease (Khelifa et al. 2010, Yasaka et al. 2014).

An unusual feature of the CaMV genome are the three single-stranded gaps in its genome. 

### CaMV Life Cycle

In nature, CaMV is spread by aphids and mostly targets brassica crops such as cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower.

The length of a single replication cycle for CaMV was found to be 21 hours across multiple host plants (Khelifa et al. 2010).
